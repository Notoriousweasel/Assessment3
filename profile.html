            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                I am 30 years old and after years of trying different fields of study and multiple jobs I have finally decided that the world of programming is the field for me (my original field of study that ended too quickly because of my choices in regards to my now ex girlfriend). I have an analytical mind and I am an excellent problem solver! I am self taught in multiple programming languages but I am currently looking to gain a better foundation.

                    <li><u>Anime:</u> I enjoy watching anime as well as reading manga (japanese comics that anime are often based off of). My favorite genres are usually shows that involve action but 'Slice-of-life' shows have been growing on me, as well as romance shows. Basically, if the show doesn't have action then I will settle for good humor and story telling!</li>
                    <li><u>Video Games:</u> I love a variaty of video games! Action adveventure games are among my favorites! I've enjoyed (the newer) Final Fantasy games, The Legend of Zelda, God of War (especially the newer one on pc), most of the Spider-man games, Mass Effect, Gears of War, Destiny 2, most Star Wars games, to name a few.</li>
                    <li><u>Animals:</u> I have been an animal lover since I was a young boy. There has rarely been a year where I didn't have some sort of pet. Reptiles are my favorites! I currently own 9 lizards and 9 snakes. I do also have a dog, she is an alomst 9 year old great pyrenees named Echo.</li>
                    <li><u>Working Out:</u> I enjoy lifting weights as well as doing body weight workouts (calisthenics). I try to make sure I do at least something physical everyday because I am prone to be really lazy otherwise.</li>

            <p>
                I am currently working toward gaining knowledge and skill in world of technology. My current field of study is in Cyber Security, a field that I find very interesting and promising. I want to learn from as many people that I can because different people have different ways of doing things. To me this means that I have to get information from more than one source because nobody has all the correct/best answers.
